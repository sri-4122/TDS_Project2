Automated Data Analysis and Visualization Utilizing GPT-4o-Mini for Enhanced Insights
Project Overview
This initiative centers on creating an advanced Python-based framework designed to automate data analysis, visualization, and insight narration from any specific dataset. By leveraging the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) alongside cutting-edge data processing and visualization methods, the framework generates detailed Markdown reports supplemented with high-quality visual representations. Crafted for flexibility, it guarantees compatibility with a diverse array of CSV datasets, addressing various analytical needs.

Key Features
1. Comprehensive Automated Analysis
Conducts thorough summary statistics, pinpoints missing values, and identifies anomalies accurately.
Carries out intricate correlation studies and clustering analyses to uncover hidden patterns within data.
Employs the LLM to deliver sophisticated insights, propose innovative analytical methods, and suggest methodological enhancements.
2. Dynamic Visualization Generation
Automatically creates 1–3 visually appealing graphs in PNG format customized for the dataset.
Utilizes a wide range of visualizations, including heatmaps and bar charts, to align with the dataset’s characteristics and analytical results.
3. Narrative and Insight Generation
Engages the LLM to develop comprehensive narratives that feature dataset descriptions, analysis strategies, key findings, and their broader significance.
Creates a cohesive Markdown report (README. md) that merges narratives with visual components for seamless understanding.
4. Efficient LLM Resource Utilization
Minimizes dependence on direct dataset exchanges by preprocessing and summarizing data before consulting the LLM.
Optimizes token usage while maintaining analytical depth and accuracy.
5. Universal CSV Dataset Compatibility
Dynamically adjusts to datasets with differing column types, distributions, and complexities, ensuring resilient and scalable performance.
6. Self-Contained and Independent Execution
Functions as a standalone script (autolysis. py) needing no external dependencies apart from standard Python libraries.
7. Ease of Use and Integration
Facilitates execution through the uv CLI tool with one command for complete functionality:
uv run autolysis. py dataset. csv
Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
Reads the input CSV file to retrieve metadata like column names, data types, and sample values.
Identifies missing data points, anomalies, and possible outliers for additional examination.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performs an extensive set of exploratory analyses, including:
Statistical summaries for all variables.
Correlation matrices to assess inter-variable relationships.
Anomaly and outlier identification.
Clustering to categorize data points with similar characteristics.
3. Seamless LLM Integration
Sends dataset metadata and EDA findings to GPT-4o-Mini for enhanced insights.
Integrates advanced Python code suggestions or additional analyses into the process.
4. Visualization Creation
Produces high-quality visualizations using libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Saves charts as PNG files in the working directory for convenient access and integration.
5. Narrative Report Generation
Utilizes the LLM to formulate a structured Markdown report comprising:
Dataset overview.
Methodology and analytical techniques.
Major findings and implications.
Embedded visualizations to enrich the narrative.
6. Output Files
Generates the following deliverables:
README. md: A comprehensive Markdown report incorporating analysis outcomes and visualizations.
*. png: A collection of PNG files that include the visualizations.
Sample Datasets
The system has been thoroughly evaluated with:
goodreads. csv: 10,000 books from GoodReads, detailing genres, ratings, and metadata.
happiness. csv: Global data from the World Happiness Report, highlighting happiness indices and contributing factors.
media. csv: Evaluations from faculty regarding films, television series, and literature, combining personal ratings with factual data.
Usage Instructions
Duplicate the repository and move to the project folder.
Set up the necessary environment variable for authentication:
export AIPROXY_TOKEN=your-token-here
Run the script using the uv CLI tool:
uv run autolysis. py dataset. csv
Retrieve the output files from the working directory:
README. md: The primary analysis document.
*. png: PNG files featuring visual representations.
Technical Notes
Optimized LLM Utilization:

Uses several queries to the LLM for thorough analyses and visualization suggestions.
Incorporates OpenAI’s function-calling API for improved accuracy.
Environment Configuration:

Needs the AIPROXY_TOKEN environment variable for LLM authentication.
Visualization Tools:

Employs Seaborn and Matplotlib to produce engaging and informative visualizations.
Deliverables
Core Python Script:
autolysis. py: An independent script that contains all features.
Generated Output Files:
Distinct folders for each dataset (e. g. , goodreads/, happiness/, media/) comprising:
README. md: The detailed Markdown report.
*. png: Visualization outputs in PNG format.
